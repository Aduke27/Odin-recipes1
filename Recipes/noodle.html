         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was  <br>
            inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup <br>
            in a jar. Try this heat-and-eat recipe for a 
            warming main to prep and tote all season long. <br>
            Use jars labeled “microwave-safe” (check the bottoms) <br>
            and never microwave the lids.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>

            <li>Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks.  <br>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over <br>
                medium-high heat. Cook tofu, turning <br>
                halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 <br>
                minutes. Cut tofu into cubes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir together green onions, miso paste, <br>
                garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl. <br>
                Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size <br>
                canning jars with lids.
            </li>
            <li>Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, <br>
                tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill, covered, <br>
                up to 5 days. To serve, see “Heat and Eat”. <br>
                Garnish with sliced green onions.
